				<h1>Here be Dragons</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>I really enjoyed playing with laser etching during the time at SAGE, so I thought I would try and make something on my own.
           My initial idea was to create something like a shadowbox, using etched clear material in order to create a shadow affect when a light was shown behind it.
          However, I soon discovered that of the material types available to etch/cut was textile materials, like suede.
          My curiosity took off, and after some initial experimentation, I decided that I would try to make a custom notebook cover.</p>

        <h2 id=sec1 alt="">Design and Experimentation</h2>
				<p>
          The first order of business was to figure out a design. 
          One idea that struck me was the phrase "Here be Dragons". Originally, the term was used to mark unknown or unexplored areas on a map.
          Thematically, I thought this would be quite cool.
          Here be dragons, says the notebook, filled with unknown wonders or dangers.
          Given my limited artistic skills, I decided to try and use imagery from some video games I was a fan of online.
          The first thought was Game of thrones, with its heavy dragon imagery, particularly the sigil of House Targaryen.
          However, after playing around with the potential design, it felt too much like I was creating branded fan-merch for Game of Thrones, especially with how recognizable the sigil would be.
          I therefore decided to search for a more obscure symbol to use.
          I eventually settled on pulling the dragon design from another mobile game I followed, Arknights. 
          They had a variety of dragon related assets in game, particularly in the character portrait backgrounds.
          The downside to using character portrait backgrounds was that I couldn't always get a clean image, and it required some cropping in order to get something usable. 
          The second challenge then came when converting the images to a usable vector image.
          Just like when I did this for <a href="/work/work02.html">SAGE</a>, I primarily did this in Inkscape, but I also had to learn and use some basic <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> to clean up the image. 
          There was a lot of complex detail that needed to be reduced down, and differing art styles between images meant I needed to constantly tweak how I did the conversion. 
          I finally settled on a design though, and had a number of prototypes made in differing colors, which you can see below.

          <div>
            <img src="/assets/img/projects/HereBeDragons/HBD_prototypes-min.jpg" style="max-width: 60vw;" class="centered">
          </div>

        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the design, I also had to do some other experimentation with how I would assemble it onto a notebook. 
          Many of the designs I saw online had opening that allowed for sewing, but I felt this was beyond my artistic skill.
          Ultimately, to keep it simple, I decided to stick with adhesive instead. 
          I would leave addition material, almost like a book flap on each end to be folded over and glued, creating a sleeve that the front/back of the notebook could be inserted into.
          I had some gorilla glue laying around, and some experimentation proved that it held quite well on the suede. 
          I also had to test exactly how much material I would need to leave in order to effectively create the flaps. 
          Rather than waste money ordering more material, I figured I could just use paper cutouts as a stand-in.
