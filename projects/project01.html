				<h1>Cartographer</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Cartographer is a project that I started after becoming interested in the marketing aspects of a business, particularly in regards to Key Opinion Leaders, Community Leaders, and Influencers.
          A big portion of marketing nowdays is related to identifying and marketing through these individuals as opposed to things like ads. However, when I inquired about a quantitative method of identifying 
        people like this at my work, it became apparent that much of this is still manually done. Rather then any quantitative approach, it more boiled down into a networking excecise then an analytical one. </p>
        <p>Seeing this as a potential avenue for improvement, or even just an alternative way to do things, this project was borne. The goal of this project was to explore quantitative methods for finding Key Opinion Leaders
          ,map their influence across a topic space, and granularly explore a certain KOL's sphere of influence. These methods could then be hopefully translated into a tool that marketing and market research analysts could then use.

        <h2 id=sec1 alt="">Starting Out</h2>
				<p>
          the planning part
          The first challenge was to figure out what exactly to measure. Influence is a fickle and weird thing to measure. In social media contexts, raw numbers are often used as a substitute, the more followers you have,
          the more influence you have. However, that ran anti-thetical to what I wanted to build. I wanted granualar analysis, not just reducing people down to a metric. Besides, my initial research into this already revealed 
          that something like this existed, the h-index. The h-index can be understood as a measure of how many citations an author received relative to how many articles they published. Many companies like thompson reuters also had their own
          propetary measures. (maybe expande more here)

          And it was here that the first idea struck me. I could implement all the citation relations into a relational database, and then once completed graph algorithms looking at centrality, pathing, etc could then be run to 
          give insights on the community and the individual in it.

        <h2 id=sec2 alt="">Pulling Data</h2>
				<p>
          pulling data and struggles
          The first major effort was pulling data to construct the relational database. My initial thought was to try pulling data from google scholar, since they looked like to had the most comprehensive listing 
          of publications. But here I ran into my first problem, namely that the data I was looking for wasn't always available. Google Scholar had no available api, so I had to resort to writing a selenium webdriver script to scrape the website. 
          But google was very aggressive in weeding out scraping scripts. I tried several solutions to evade this, including having the script randomly perform actions, and routing the connection through TOR, but I ultimately concluded that it wasn't worth the time and effort I was putting in. 
          I was spending more time fighting Google then actually building the database.<a> script here </a> And so I went looking for other solutions. 
          
        </p>
        <p>
           This turned out to be the correct decision, as more searching revelaed the presence of data sources WITH API's, namely Pubmed and Crossref. Both had api's that importantly not only listed an article's references, but also citations from other articles. 
           I was able to use those api's to write a script to pull articles. I initially structured to script to pull recursively from a single "seed" article, that is it would pull the seed's citations and references, and then use those pull their own citations and references, and so on and so forth.
           However, I quickly discovered it was a lot easier to just use Pubmed's term search function simulating a keyword search to pull an entire list first and go from there. To start out, I used the keyword "Urology", since I was already familiar with the space from work and could use that as sort of a validation that I was pulling 
           relevant articles. I quickly discovered that within one recursion, I was already starting to get non-urology related articles, and the number of articles was also starting to inrease exponentially, so I cut if off at 1 (confirm) recursion. The final article count pulled for the initial test case was 
           approximately 100k. <a>clean up script and put it here </a>

        <h2 id=sec3 alt="">Creating the Graph Database</h2>
				<p>
          using neo4j to create an relation database, including the insertion scripts, 
          For creating the graph relation database, I went with using neo4j. 
          Neo4j was my first introduction to graph relation databases, and rather than try and re-learn an entirely different system, I decided to go with what I was familiar with.
          Setup of the database wasquite simple, with nodes created for authors, publications, and journals. I also made the decision to use separate nodes for associated keywords and the publication type, rather then just 
          
        </p>
        <p>figureing out faster ways of doing things (indexing, load csv, etc. )
          One of those improvements was to drastically reduce the time needed to insert new nodes into the db. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Things to improve on -dates needed preprocessing, not helped by the fact that they came in many different formats. Probably an entire script needed to be implemented to sort this out. Held off on it since this was the intial prototype run. 
          Author disambiguation. This is apparently a major issue, with some major research effort put into it. The main challenge came from the different ways people 


          Address disambiguation- I had an article where each author put in the same address three different ways. How the hell are you supposed to deal with this? no idea. Iexplroed a number of ideas, like looking at cosine simularity between them and then if they were similar enough, to combine them .

				<p>
          using the db, ie running Pagerank, etc. link our sample analytical product 
          Probably the most interesting part of my work was related to supporting Pre-Clinical and Clinical Trials, and not just because I got to travel.
          Any medical device development is always accompanied by testing both in-vivo and in-vitro.
          At Prodeon Medical, I had the opportunity to be directly involved in cadaver, animal, and First-in-Human clinical trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organ cadavers were my first exposure to testing outside the bench, and was an invaluable tool in evaluating early designs.
          Even the best bench models had limitations, and so these tests allowed us to rapidly screen out designs and test the feasibility of our proposed procedure.
          Our extensive cadaver studies helped immensely in allowing us to succesfully start a longer term animal study within a year or so of the project start.
        </p>

        <P>
          I was extensively involved our animal trials, using the knowledge gained to evaluate potential designs, and to test the long-term efficacy of the implant. Here I manufactured and prepared devices to be used, 
          worked with the vetinary surgeon to implant the devices, and analyzed the collected data such as x-rays. I was also responsible for defining and executing our post-retrieval testing for the implants, which included 
          mechanical testing, and SEM imaging of the surface.
          
        </P>
        <p>
          When the time came for clinical trials, I was on the ground in Europe, Asia, and Australia training the first physicians for the First in Human <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03758222">EXPANDER-1 Trial</a>.
          I also provided remote technical support and helped execute device deficiency investigations.

        <h2 id=sec5 alt="">future efforts and things to improve on </h2>

        <P>
          talking with actual marketing friends-actaul way to expand this to non citations? ie maybe mentions in publichsed articles? from the db perspective this is easy, from the dat agathering perspective Im not sure how I would go about doing this, besides a mass scrape. 
          
          talking with marketing experienced- very valuable for initial starting out and for larger marketing teams, less so for middle ground(know the space already). Thinking about adding more features, such as more info on the articles, ie pulling topics from the abstracts,
          better implmementing keywords(maybe lemmatized) to allow better segmentation. 
          
        </P>
        <p>better preprocessing mentioned above
          </p>
				<p>
          pull way more articles, not just from a single seed. will need to be scaled up, since was already taking ahot minute
