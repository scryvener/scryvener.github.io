				<h1>Market Research</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Despite working as an engineer as my day job, I have always have an interest in Market Research. I think a lot of it drives from my desire to figure out how things tick.
          Just like how taking apart a machine can help you figure out the mechanics, I liked looking at data to see what it told me about the world. Here you can see my various adventures in doing 
          Market research on my own.

        <h2 id=sec1 alt="">The initial foray-2019 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Market</h2>
				<p>
          My first foray into market research came as a bit of an accident. You can read the background here (link back to work section).
          The Marketing department at my workplace was looking into developing market models, and needed better data on things like procedure volume.
          That work seemed interesting enough, so I thought I would take a stab at it in my own time. 
          The first thing I thought of was an article written about how data from medicare cms was used to compare drug prices between US states.
          I decided to start digging down that route as a start. 
          This led me to the first data source I used. 
          <a>Medicare CMS</a> publishes yearly reimbursement data for procedures.
          While it didn't cover the entire US market, it would allow for a solid starting point. 
          Some follow up research for reimbursement data showed that private coverers closely guard their data, so any further data on this wouldn't be helpful.
          While this would be the main source of data, I also found other sources that I could combine to create a fuller picture.
          The first was <a>Open Payments</a>.
          Due to US Transparency laws, physicians are required to report on payments they receive from companies, and this datais publicly available.
          I figured I could comb through this to find those with high payments 
          
          I also found Open payments. and also decided to use google trneds, and also clinical trials.gov
          I also took the opportunity to download a trial version of <a>Tableau</a> to use for this.
          I figured that I may as well use this as an opporunity to learn about some of the tools that people often use for this.
          In addition, I also decided to try my hand with using my recently(at the time) learned python skills to data analysis and visualization. 
          While I wasn't able to do as much as I was hoping, I was able to use the opportunity to learn the Plotly library to create several of the graphs in the final report.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I found all that data, I did analysis. 
          There wasn't a main goal here, since I was doing this more for my own interest. 
          I just kind of went with the flow with what I found in the data.
          My analysis ended up focusing on a few main areas:
          <ul>
            <li>Use drug and procedure data to find market composition, and more granular analysis such as where procedures are performed</li>
            <li>Find competitor Very Important Persons (VIP) based on procedure volume and payment data.</li>
            <li>Use publicly available information to calculate and compare competitor market performance and growth.</li>
          </ul>

          
        </p>

        <p>
          You can see the final "product" that I put together here.

        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back/improvements
          things I wanted to do-Open payments also allows a listing for products. Could potentially use this to do a more detailed analysis. For example, I had a hypothesis that you could use this to back calculate a companies marketing priorities, and therefore gain intelligence on a companies business strategy.

        <h2 id=sec2 alt="">Endovine- Market Size Research</h2>
				<p>
          Like many ideas, Endovine came to me after watching a youtube video on soft robotics and vine robots. (links)
          I struck upon the idea of potentially using them as a replacement for endoscopes and cystoscopes, taking advantage of their soft nature to reduce the overall risks to the patients.
          After talking with some of my mentors, they advised me that before embarking on any techncial development, I should go about looking for dealbreakers. 
          One of the main ones I looked into was researching Market Size, an important part of any pitch.
          I approached this from the perspective of a potential pitch.
          After all, it would be quite difficult to convince backers to fund a project like this if there was no real need besides my engineering curiosity.
          And so with that in mind, I set about my second real Market research project, looking into and estimating the market size for a potential gastro-intestinal product.
