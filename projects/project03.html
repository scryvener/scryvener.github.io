				<p>
          My first foray into market research came as a bit of an accident. You can read the background here (link back to work).

        <h2 id=sec2 alt="">Endovine- Market Size Research</h2>
				<p>
          Like many ideas, Endovine came to me after watching a youtube video on soft robotics and vine robots. (links)
          I struck upon the idea of potentially using them as a replacement for endoscopes and cystoscopes, taking advantage of their soft nature to reduce the overall risks to the patients.
          After talking with some of my mentors, they advised me that before embarking on any techncial development, I should go about looking for dealbreakers. 
          One of those was the potential market size.
          After all, it would be quite difficult to convince backers to fund a project like this if there was no real need besides my engineering curiosity.
          And so with that in mind, I set about my second real Market research project, looking into the market size for a potential gastro-intestinal product.

        </p>
        <p>
          The first step was to look for some relevant target indications for use. 
          From there, we could then get a Total Addressable Market, and approximate how much of a market opportunity this was. 

          Looking for market figures- and using other companies interst as a proxy.

        <h2 id=sec3 alt="">Creating the Graph</h2>
				<p>
          using neo4j to create an relation database
          Medical Device development would not be complete without documentation. My work here could be divided into two main categories, R&D Design Control related work and product testing related work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My Design Control work included authoring the technical drawings for components I was responsible for, and also associated specs in our Product Specification document.
          Risk documentation was also a significant portion of my work here.
          I was responsible for authoring Hazard Analyses, and various Failure Mode Effects Analyses cover the design and use of our various devices.
          Finally, I also provided support for design reviews, authoring everything from memos to powerpoint slides to gap analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing work encompassed all the documentation that came with both in-house testing we did, such as functional deployment, and testing performed with outside partners, such as for biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, MRI safety, or Finite Element Analyses.
          I was responsible for authoring Test Protocols and Reports, as well as Standard Test Methods(STM).
          For many STMs, I also was responsible for executing a Gauge R&R Study on our test methods.
          I was in charge of setting up the design of the study, executing it, and then analyzing the data in <a href="https://www.minitab.com/en-us/">Minitab</a>, looking at the variance components and the ANOVA report. 
          In certain cases, some test methods had unacceptabily high variance, and so I was also responsible for coming up with solutions to reduce it. 
          Most methods could be improved by simply using more precise equipment, ie swapping a ruler for caliper.
          However, for certain methods, especially those unique to our device, this entailed having to rethink how the test was executed, or having to implement changes to the test fixture.

				<p>
          using the db, ie running Pagerank, etc. 
          Probably the most interesting part of my work was related to supporting Pre-Clinical and Clinical Trials, and not just because I got to travel.
          Any medical device development is always accompanied by testing both in-vivo and in-vitro.
          At Prodeon Medical, I had the opportunity to be directly involved in cadaver, animal, and First-in-Human clinical trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organ cadavers were my first exposure to testing outside the bench, and was an invaluable tool in evaluating early designs.
          Even the best bench models had limitations, and so these tests allowed us to rapidly screen out designs and test the feasibility of our proposed procedure.
          Our extensive cadaver studies helped immensely in allowing us to succesfully start a longer term animal study within a year or so of the project start.
        </p>

        <P>
          I was extensively involved our animal trials, using the knowledge gained to evaluate potential designs, and to test the long-term efficacy of the implant. Here I manufactured and prepared devices to be used, 
          worked with the vetinary surgeon to implant the devices, and analyzed the collected data such as x-rays. I was also responsible for defining and executing our post-retrieval testing for the implants, which included 
          mechanical testing, and SEM imaging of the surface.
          
        </P>
        <p>
          When the time came for clinical trials, I was on the ground in Europe, Asia, and Australia training the first physicians for the First in Human <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03758222">EXPANDER-1 Trial</a>.
          I also provided remote technical support and helped execute device deficiency investigations.

        <P> Getting feedback from end-users of the product you develop is important, and at Prodeon, I regularly interfaced with Physicians to get their feedback on design decisions. Through local physicians,
          we were able to drive a rapid prototype schedule. We would frequently develop using a shotgun approach of 3-4 different concpets or variations, and then bring them to evaluate. Through this rapid pace, 
          we were able to go from concept to a First-in-Human trial in around 2 years. 
        </P>
        <p>One highlight was when I got to attend the 2018 American Urology Association meeting in San Francisco . It was an invaluable experience, where we were able to demo to both 
          potential partners and active collaborators our next generation designs. I was also able to take the chance to familiarize myself with the state of the art in Urology, such as new surgical robotics, which helped 
          build a better understanding of the strength's of our product's approach. 
          </p>

          Marketing is also how I began becoming interested in data analytics work.
          Our marketing manager was developing financial models to project future growth, and model the current market state, ie which procedures were used most often.
          The problem sounded interesting enough to me, and so I independently embarked on a hunt to see what I could put together on my own.
          You can see the result of my little side adventure <a>here</a>. <!-- link out to project section  -->

          Another problem that came up was how to identify Key Opinion Leaders.
          From my R&D point of view, the process seemed a bit daunting, ie how would you be able to compare hundreds to thousands of different physicians, with any degree of nuance or specificity?
          Talking with marketing, they confirmed to me that the entire process was indeed very manual, and mostly boiled down to networking.
          This seemed like a sufficient unmet need to devote some effort to, you can see the project that came from this here <a>link to cartographer</a>
