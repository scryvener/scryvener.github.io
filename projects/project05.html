				<h1>Google Trends Analytics-Covid-19 Vaccination and "Near Me"</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
          My interest in search trends started from an unlikely source, public polling.
          I have always been fascinated with the roll of public polling, but I have always personally found it vulnerable to sampling biases.
          This was apparent in the 2020 and 2016 US presidential elections.
          I therefore wanted to see if there was a way to better measure public sentiment. 
          The idea that I came upon was by using search engine data.
          After all, as the saying goes, “You are never more honest than with your search engine”.
          Theres even jokes about deleting searching history when you are on your deathbed.
          This seemed like a perfect measure of revealed preference.
          People can decide not to respond to polls; they can be hesitant to respond truthfully depending on both the political (i.e., an authoritarian state where dissenting views can get you in trouble) or social environment (i.e., you hold conservative views in a highly liberal area or vice versa).
          But they would be honest when they do their internet searches.
          Since Google helpfully allows searches using Google Trends, I decided that this was a perfect opportunity to explore.

        <h2 id=sec1 alt="">The First Search</h2>
				<p>
          My first search was centered on the “near me” search, where I noticed that covid related terms were showing up, including those related to vaccination.
          I also noticed that they were showing up in different frequencies between US states.
          This formed a hypothesis in my head: States with more Covid related searches should have more vaccinations.
          This made sense intuitively: those skeptical of Covid should be less likely to get vaccinated.
          Even more helpfully, vaccination data and search trend data could be broken out per state, allowing differentiation to be made.
          Timewise, I decided to split out the analysis by year.
          This was mainly from a convenience perspective.
          I initially wanted to do month by month, but Google Trends doesn't have an API, so this would mean I would have to manually pull 600 csv's per year.
          Given my past experience fighting Google's anti-botting measures, I decided to simplify this down to a yearly pull, one for 2020 and one for 2021.

        <h2 id=sec2 alt="">Results and Analysis</h2>
				<p>
          You can see the script file I used <a href="">here</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Preparing and processing the data after downloading it from Google Trends was a relatively simple affair, with most of the cleaning effort going to processing Google's weird csv export format.
          Google Trends exports two main ways of showing interest, Top search trends and rising search trends.
          While I extracted both, I ultimately decided to use the data from Rising search interest.
          The main problem with using Top was that vaccination interest wasn't enough to crowd out people's other normal Google searches, even very Covid cautious states in the Northeast and the West coast.
          The only Covid related term that showed up was “Covid Testing near me”. With my main focus on vaccines, I had to instead use the “Rising” search terms instead.
          I tried various methods of quantifying the results.
          I played around with trying to play with the % changes that Google gave, but the existence of “Breakouts”, which Google uses to denote terms with extreme increases, usually because they were very rarely or never searched before, complicated things.
          I explored converting Breakouts into numeric values, but there were too many assumptions for me to feel comfortable using that.
          If I tried to average the % values for example, I would be artificially lowering states with lots of breakout terms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I went with simply counting how many times a search term with “covid” in it showed up.
          This made both intuitive sense and could be done without much effort, so I went with it.
          After the results were counted up and converted into DataFrames using the pandas library, I then proceeded to create some visualizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also took the chance to play with Seaborn.
          Seaborn had been on my radar as a visualization library, but I never really had an excuse to use it, so I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity here to try it out.
          I used it primarily to generate two plots, one showing 2020 and one showing 2021.
          I was initially going to use boxplots, but I also wanted to show how varied the distribution could be in some cases, so I decided to use violin plots instead.
          You can see the results below.

              <a><img class="img-responsive folio_icon center" src="/assets/img/projects/SearchTrends/2020Vax.png" style="width:100%;height:100%"/></a>

          </div><!-- /row -->
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, 2020 shows very little correlation but on 2021, there is somewhat of a linear correlation with how often Covid shows up in the Google search queries.
          I confirmed this by performing linear regression using sklearn for each year.
          The R-score for 2020 was only 0.082, while the 2021 R-score was 0.493.
          This confirmed what I saw visually, that 2021 search results were linearly correlated with vaccination rates, while 2020 search results were not.

        <h2 id=sec3 alt="">Theory and Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          The results were interesting to me, but after some thought I developed a theory that made some sense.
          In 2020, Covid was still a new disease, and there would be search interest no matter your opinion on vaccination just due to novelty.
          But when vaccines became more widely available in 2021, search results became self-selecting, and those more skeptical of Covid wouldn't bother searching for vaccination.
          This theory was also supported by the idea that search results are a revealed preference.
          Looking at these results, I therefore concluded that search results would be a relatively accurate way of judging the populations interest and opinions regarding Covid vaccination.
        </p>

        <h2 id=sec4 alt="">Looking Back and Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I think if I went back to do this analysis again, I would try to go more granular on the timescale, perhaps by quarters rather than the full year.
          A year is a long time, and a lot can happen that gets lost when all the search trends get compressed into a year. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I would also be interested to see how a direct search of “covid” would reveal.
          The search term that was used was “near me”, which naturally diluted the search results with searches for things like food, gas stations, etc.
          This allowed for representation for how much priority was given to covid, but I felt also diluted any granularity within the covid search term itself.
          For example, I would be interested to see if the appearance of certain terms correlated with higher or lower vaccination rates, ie the appearance of “conspiracy” with Covid searches would correlate with lower vaccination rates. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, this was a fun and interesting adventure, and I hope to perform more analysis on Google Trends in the future.
