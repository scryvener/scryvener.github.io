				<h1>SAGE</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
          SAGE was a side project with a few other friends, focused around building and strenghening the gaming community through innovation, entertainment, and tournament organization. 
          Our main focus was <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us">Lost Ark</a>, released in February 2022.
        </p>
        <P>
          Technically, I was CTO, Chief Technical Officer, responsible for building tools that improved the live-stream and competitive experience, 
          tournament analytics, SEO efforts, and technical collaborations. But since there was only ever five people, lots of hats were worn, from stream moderating to creating clips for social media posts.</P>
        <p>
          The title was fancy, but that wasn't really the point. The proudest moments were the messages of thanks from competitors, and the awe of viewers.
          The best memories were from working with my friends. Getting to combine my passion for analytics with my hobby of video games was a dream come true. 
          I had a lot of fun working on this, even if circumstances outside our control led to its early end.</p>
        <p>
          I picked out some highlights of my work with SAGE below.

        <h3>Twitch Extension</h3>
				<p>
          The highlight of my time at SAGE. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/">Twitch Extensions</a> allow for a next level of interactive experiences with the audience,
          beyond just chat. I developed an extension for use with one of our tournaments, allowing viewers to see competitors builds, stats, and other game info that normally wouldn't be accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a major undertaking for two reasons:
          <br>
          <b>First:</b>
          The game developer had no public api available, and Twitch required all files, 
          including media, to be submitted as part of the publishing review process, which had to be done days ahead of time.
          Which then ran into the problem that the competitors themseles wouldn't finalize their in-game stats and info until the day of.
          Normally, you could query the api to pull a competitors real time, in-game data, and all this wouldn't be a problem. But there wasn't, and so I had to think of a way to feed the extension information.
          My solution was to create essentially our own psuedo-api, taking the form of an xml page hosted on github that the extension could query to know what data to display. 
          <br>

          <b>Second:</b>
          This was my first time coding in html/css/javascript. Small problem I know. I was essentially crash coursing my way through this, learning the languages as I built it.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, I got it done, in about a month and a half. The extension was successfully used for our tournament, improving the viewing experience of the over 3k people that watched.  </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't all perfect though, I made a lot of mistakes and learned alot as I built my way through this. The most important lesson was the value of testing. 
          Certain bugs compatibility issues could have been detected earlier, a lot of work could have been saved had I tested properly. The bug that stood out was related to displaying a certain number of skills.
          Due to how I wrote the js, essentially an overflow would happen after the skill count went to 10 or more, and skills wouldn't display properly. I was furious with myself when I found the bug, the day before the tournament, and all files 
          essentially frozen. "Test Early, Test Often, and Test Accurately" is now the maxim I repeat to myself. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Lot of words, but wouldn't it be cool if you could play with it yourself? Since Twitch Extensions are built like web pages, I can insert an iframe so you can! Sizing is a bit small, since it was designed for a full screen, but 
          you should be able to see the full functionality. 
          The extension was designed to be draggable, so that viewers could place it wherever worked best for them in the window, and a show/hide functionality so they could hide it when they wanted to focus on the match.
          You can check out the code on github! <i>insert github link</i>
