				<h1>SAGE</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
          SAGE was a side gig with some friends, focused around building and strengthening the gaming community through innovation, entertainment, and tournament organization. 
          Our main focus was <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us">Lost Ark</a>, released in February 2022. We held and live-streamed exhibition tournaments, and organized a tournament league, Arkives Arena,
          where teams of 3 competed against each other for cash prizes. You can check out our website <a href="https://www.arkives.info/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <P>
          Technically, I was CTO, Chief Technology Officer. I was responsible for all of our technical projects: building tools that improved the live-stream and competitive experience, 
          tournament analytics, SEO efforts, and technical collaborations. But since there was only ever five people, I wore a lot more hats then just purely tech development, from stream moderating to creating video clips for social media posts.</P>
        <p>
          The title was fancy, but that wasn't really the point. The proudest moments were the messages of thanks from competitors and the viewers.
          The best memories were from working with my friends. Getting to combine my passion for analytics with my hobby of video games was a dream come true. 
          I had a lot of fun working on this, even if issues with the game outside our control led to its early end, and many projects unfinished.</p>

        <h2 id=sec1 alt="">Twitch Extension</h2>
				<p>
          The highlight of my time at SAGE. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/">Twitch Extensions</a> allow for a next level of interactive experiences with the audience,
          beyond just chat. I developed an extension for use with one of our tournaments, allowing viewers to see competitors builds, stats, and other game info that normally wouldn't be accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a major undertaking for two reasons:
          <br>
          <b>First:</b>
          This was my first time coding in html/css/javascript. Minor problem, I know. I was essentially crash coursing my way through this, learning the language(s) as I built it.
          <br>
          <b>Second:</b>
          The game developer had no public api available, and Twitch required all files, 
          including media, to be submitted as part of the publishing review process, which had to be done days ahead of time.
          Which then ran into the problem that the competitors themseles wouldn't finalize their in-game stats and info until the day of.
          Normally, you could query the api to pull a competitors real time, in-game data, and all this wouldn't be a problem. But there wasn't, and so I had to think of a way to feed the extension information.
          My solution was to create essentially our own psuedo-api, taking the form of an xml page hosted on github that the extension could query to know what data to display. 
          <br>
          <b>Third:</b>
          Not having an api meant that I also had to have all of the potential assets needed on hand. I got partially lucky here, since the image assets and descriptions were readily scrapable,
          and I was able to do so with a basic <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">requests</a> script. You can see the script here <a><i>github link here</i></a> My luck didn't last throughout though, particularly in regards to the skill descriptions. For whatever
          reason, certain descriptions were either incomplete, or featured errors, ie a skill was listed as doing 0 damage. I tried to cross reference between sites, but this wasn't foolproof, since the information could be sometimes universally missing,
          or two sites would have conflicting information. Ultimately, the best and most consistent information I found was on the Korean sites, particulaly Inven, which made sense since the game was first released in South Korea.   
          
        </p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, I was able to succesfully code a working extension with all of our desired functionality in about a month and a half.
           The extension was successfully used for our tournament, improving the viewing experience of the over 3k people that watched.  </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't all perfect though, I made a lot of mistakes and learned alot as I built my way through this. The most important lesson was the value of testing. 
          Certain bugs and compatibility issues could have been detected earlier, a lot of work could have been saved had I tested properly. The bug that stood out was related to displaying a certain number of skills.
          Due to how I wrote the js, essentially an overflow would happen after the skill count went to 10 or more, and skills wouldn't display properly. I was furious with myself when I found the bug, the day before the tournament, and all files 
          essentially frozen. "Test Early, Test Often, and Test Accurately" is now the maxim I repeat to myself. 
        </p>
        
        <p>I thought it would be cool for other to be able to play with the extension, particularly since it would only ever be available during a stream. The nice thing is that Twitch Extensions are built like webpages, so I can insert an iframe here to demo it.
          Sizing is a bit small, since it was designed for a full screen, but you should be able to see the full functionality. 
          The extension was designed to be draggable, so that viewers could place it wherever worked best for them in the window, and a show/hide functionality so they could hide it when they wanted to focus on the match.
          You can check out the code on github here <i>insert github link</i>

        <h2 id=sec2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
				<p>
          One of my other responsibilities was to research and explore ways of driving traffic to our content, primarily our website and Youtube videos. We were after all, essentially a content creation company, and attention would be how we could eventually monetize.
          I learned a lot about the importance of backlinking, using tags, and other tricks of the trade in order to try and drive more traffic to our content. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Youtube wise my effort was on researching hash tags and video tags, adding channel descriptions and links, and strategizing on how to promote the videos through our other social media, like Twitter.
           The video front was rough, we started our SEO and promotion efforts late, after the initial hype period of release, so we got hurt with the drop in attention as the hype faded. 
        </p>
        <p>In terms of search, my efforts mainly focused on curating the titles, descriptions, and search appearances of our web pages, and thinking of different ways
           to drive traffic and backlinks. One such way was such as embedding our tournament registration and forms on the site directly. Tournament organization was done with a third party, 
           Smash.gg, now <a href="https://www.start.gg/">start.gg</a>, so this would have helped boost our numbers by centering all the user interaction on our pages rather the be split in different locations.
          </p>
        <p>
            I would say I was pretty successful on the search front. From late April, when I started implementing SEO, I pushed us from rank 6-8 in to 1-2 for one of the most relevant keywords, "lost ark pvp tournaments", which you can see below.
          </p>

      </div>

        <img src="/assets/img/work/work02-SAGE/SEO performance-Arkives.PNG" style="max-width: 60vw;" class="centered">
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Unfortunately though, this is where I learned another important lesson. SEO works best when you have the potential audience in the first place. Put another way,
          It doesn't matter if you're rank 1 on the search query, if only a few people search for that query. Your traffic won't improve dramatically. And that is 
          ultimately the problem we ran into. The competitive PVP aspects of the game just weren't that popular. It had a dedicated fan base that loved what we did, but it was a tiny fraction
          of the overall game population, and with very little support from the game developer themselves. 
          So in the end, i could SEO all I wanted, but it wasn't solving the core issue of how to bring in fresh blood to the competitive scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main takeaway is that SEO is just one tool in the Marketing playbook. Like it's name says, it optimizes. It can help amplify interest, but it can't create interest out of nowhere. You still have to put in the legwork and build a customer base.

      <h2 id=sec3>Tournmant Analytics and Companion App</h2>
      <p>
        One of the initial draws for me to get involved at SAGE was the opportunity to perform analytics work on tournament data. Our plans were for a league-like tournament series, which would allow us to collect
        quite a lot of tournament data that could be analyzed. In addition, there were plans to create a companion app in the same vein as fitness trackers, that would be used by players to better track, analyze, and 
        improve their performance. The app would offer both basic data tracking, and analytics services. This would have the side function of allowing us to collect large amounts of individual player match data, which could then be analyzed as well. This was a major initiative for us, 
        especially since one of our sponsors was interested in the companion app as well, and were interested in cooperating on its development.  
      </p>
      <p>
        My first steps were to explore what sort of technologies we would need to build out for the companion app. Just like with the <a href="#sec1">Twitch Extension</a>, the lack of any sort of API would make things much more difficult.
        Not only did we need to develop an app, we would likely need new technology to pull the data. As CTO, I quickly jumped in to exploring what we would need, possible technologies we could use, and planning out a development timeline.
        This was incorporated into a project plan that mapped out resource estimates and a detailed proposed architecture of the app, and also a pitch deck that went over each phase of development. I got quite ambitious with this,
        my goal was to eventually be able to collect video data of each match, and use it to construct an "engine", similar to chess engines like <a href="'https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a>, where each player move could be scored and evaluated.
        Chess engines are an invaluable way for players to improve their game, pointing out not only mistakes but also missed opportunities. I wanted to build something like that for Lost Ark.
        
        In addition to the project planning work, I also began work prototyping out some of the potential technology we would need. We settled on using an image recognition system to pull data from the post-match scoreboard that would appear after every game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, about the time this was finished is also when we began to suffer from the effects of the hype dropoff mentioned in the <a href="#sec2">SEO</a> section. The dropoff in participants was particularly a problem, since 
        without them we wouldn't be able to even hold a tournament. This was an existential problem, since our entire operation was based on holding tournaments. As such, work on the companion app was put on hold so we could
        focus all of our efforts on boosting participation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My prototyping efforts weren't completely for nothing though. One of the initiatives we decided on to try and boost our brand recognition, and then hopefully our participation, was to publish a series of post-tournament analysis reports. 
        In these, we would go over topics like the meta for a tournament, interesting team compositions, etc. In order to pull data efficiently from the scoreboards, I re-used the two pieces of tech I prototyped for the training app:
        a script that leveraged Tesseract OCR for text detection, and a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the unique class icons.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The need for both OCR and an image classifier was due to two different types of data showing up on the scoreboard, as can be seen in the sample scoreboard below. 
        <img src="/assets/img/work/work02-SAGE/scoreboard_example.png" style="max-height:800px; max-width:1200px">
        The class icons, seen next to each player's name, were the only way to tell what class each player was playing. This was vital for further analysis of team compositions and the like, so this needed to be pulled and converted into data.
        At the same time, there exists a lot of text data, in the Kill, Deaths and Assists and Damage stats. You can find the final script <a><i>final OCR script link here</i></a>, and I go over my efforts below.
        
        
        
      </p>
      <h3>Optical Character Recognition</h3>
      <p>
        
        I didn't want to re-invent the wheel for Optical Character recognition, so I settled on using an off the shelf model that my research had identified as promising, <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract">Tesseract</a>, to pull the text data.
        I quickly located a guide going over how to setup Tesseract and using <a hre="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> to pre-process the images.
        I also found a package to utilize <a href="https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract">tesseract in Python, </a> which made things a lot easier since I was most familiar with Python. Some quick testing on the scoreboards was fruitful,
        as I immediately identified the main challenges.
        
        <br>
        <b>First:</b>
        The first challenge was related to character recognition. I quickly realized that proper pre-processing the text was vital here. Tesseract worked best with text at a certain size, and with minimal background noise. The first was easy to take care of, using OpenCV to resize the images,
        but the second required some experimentation with filters in order to get optimal and consistent recognition of the text. The scoreboard's gradient like background didn't help in this regard, but thresholding was able to take care of it sufficiently.
        <br>
        <b>Second:</b>
        The second challenge was text detection on the image itself. That is, Tessearct would often not consistently find all the text on a given image, would find a lot of miscellaneous artifacts that weren't actually text, and would not output
        the detected text in a consistent format. Some research on Tessearct's limitations confirmed this, since it apparently was designed to work best with things like scanned book pages. The solution to this was to manually
        define locations on the image for Tessearct to search for. The clips could then be pre-processed like above, and I could then control which values got outputed where. This created a further challenge though, since manually specifying where on the page to detect text 
        made the system very brittle. All it would take was somebody playing the game at a different aspect ratio, or resolution to mess up the recognition. This wasn't an issue for scoreboard detection for our tournaments, since I could control the screenshot outputs. However,
        when I was planning to use this for our companion app, I had to implement additional pre-processing, such as a function that would check and crop out black bars if the player was playing with a forced aspect ratio.
        <br>
        <b>Third:</b>
        The final challenge was relatively minor compared to the others, but still a pain to deal with. And that was with player names. Tesseract struggled the most here, with multiple instances of mistakes due to things like special characters. Tesseract would also struggle with how consistently confident it was here,
        which made thresholding a value to get rid of artifacts difficult. Too low and an occasional blip would get interpreted as text and throw off the results, too high and it would miss names it pulled correctly. Ultimately, I veered toward caution, which meant that I occasionally had to  
        manually correct or enter names.
        
        <br>
        Ultimately though, these challenges were relatively straightforward to overcome, and the Tesseract portion of the system worked quite well. It had some occasional mistakes, such as reporting 1's as 7's, and the aforementioned issues with names,
        but it saved me a bunch of time from having to do manual data entry for the text portion of the scoreboard.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Class Icon Classifier</h3>
      
      <p>The next step would be a custom Class Icon Classifier. For this, I decided on using a basic Convolutional Neural Network, which I had learned about from my previous Coursera Machine Learning courses. I chose to use <a href="'https://keras.io/">Keras</a>, 
        being the library I was most familiar with, and also because how simple it was to setup and tweak architecture. Getting an initial dataset was a relatively easy affair, since my friend was already screen capturing
        his own scoreboards for tracking his own pvp journey. This made things easy to start out, but also proved to be the beginnings of my non-stop fight with data problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first problem I encountered was with the number of classes. Lost Ark released in the global market without all of its classes, and at the same time, was also releasing more classes over time. This meant that I had to essentially re-train the model every time 
        a new class came out. 

        The second problem, and the major headache, was aspect ratios and resolutions. The base dataset I got from my friend was all in one ratio, and all at one resolution. However, first, not everybody played with the same resolution,
        so the sample images would have require resizing to accomodate a set sample width and height. The issue with aspect ratios was also thorny. The meta for PvP was to force a 21:9 widescreen ratio, since that improved in-game Field of View, but that meant for many players
        they were playing with black bars on the screen. Resizing from there would distort the class icon images, throwing off the classifier. I found this out the hard way when I tried to use my initially trained model on our first tournament data captures. It just completely failed,
        often identifying nothing correctly, or only by random chance. 
        
        Unfortunately here, the issue of time popped up. There was pressure to get analytics out quickly, and so as an interim solution, I went ahead and just did the data entry for class icons by hand. It wasn't my first choice,
        but given the need to balance how much potential time it would have taken to debug and re-train the model, versus getting analytical product out quickly, it was the best solution I had at the time. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While work was since stopped, it still bothers me to this day that the classifier failed so badly, and I would like to return to this again. 
        My main plan of attack would be a to first do a sample-by-sample dive, to see how the weights looked through training and prediction, and a detailed look into the effect of resizing the images. After that,
        I would introduce a more comprehensive, and representative sample expansion into the training images that reflected the distortions. In parallel, I would also solicit more data. 
      </p>
        
      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        Analytical Product/link in how we could still potentially use the stuff we developed

        After succesfully extracting data from the scoreboards, whether by script or by hand, I was able to perform analysis on our tournaments data. I primarily leveraged the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> library for this,
        and you can see the main script I used to group and process the data <a><i>analytical process script here</i></a>. Graphics wise, I mainly stuck with just using excel.
        While using something like matplotlib was a possibility, I prioritized speed at this point more than customization. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The main points of focus were on team compositions, performance of each of the classes, and also player performances. Player performance was a relatively straightforward task, ie look for the player with the best 
        damage stats, the best Kill Death Assist Ratio, etc. For team composition and class picks I could play a bit more with visualizations. You can see some of the example graphs that I generated below.

        <div class="row centered">

            <h4>Pick Rate Change</h4>
            <p>A quick representation for how player pick priority changed between our March and April Tournaments and between two regions. Using the graph, you can easily see how both regions began heavily
              prioritizing certain classes, contributing to what some viewers commented as "same comp every game".

            <a><img class="img-responsive folio_icon center" src="/assets/img/work/work02-SAGE/RegionPickPriority.jpg" style="width:100%;height:100%"/></a>
            <h4>Region Pick Priority</h4>
            <p>A graph showed how each of our regions had different priorities when it came to picking classes. For example, the Shadowhunter class was overwhelmingly popular in South America, but was rarely picked elsewhere. You can also see that certain classes
              were unique for each region, such as how only in the NA West region would you see the Berserker class.

      <h2 id=sec4>Competitor Experience Improvement</h2>

      <p>
        Not all the work I did were big projects. Sometimes, some of the more impactful things you can work on are also the simplest. That was the case here, where I leveraged some basic api's and existing, common
        tech in order to improve the experience for those competing in the tournaments we hosted. It's hard to quantify how "smooth" a tournament is, but I can leave off with we received nothing but compliments from 
        competitors for how we ran things, and how we were told multiple times we were the best run tournament scene.
      </p>

      <h3>Tournament Communications</h3>
      <p>
        We did a lot of scouting of how other Tournament Organizers ran their competitions, so we could hopefully both learn from their mistakes, and adopt their good ideas.
        One of the most common issues we saw was the difficulty in coordinating and ensuring communications between all the competitors. Just like us, most  used third party organization apps like Start.gg,
        but there was no method to easily translate out of game contact information into in-game character names. The end result was usually clogged discord channels filled with people trying to ping one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution I came up with was relatively simple, and consisted of two parts. The first would be a google form that would be sent out to all team captains to fill out before the match. The form would ask
        for their teams contact information, and in-game character names. The results for the survey would then be put on a publicly available, locked, google sheet, allowing all the competitors an easy, searchable way
        to find and contact their opponents.
      </p>

      <p>
        This worked amazingly well. Every tournament we ran was incredibly smooth, with next to no instances of competitors being unreachable. We occasionally had to hunt down team's that didn't respond to the form,
        but the extra prep work would pay off into essentially self-running tournament, where the most we had to do was be on hand to answer questions.
        We were also able to expand the forms into a mode for data collection by adding a section about team composition. This allowed us to perform <a href="#sec3">tournament analytics</a>
        on the data, and get insight into the most commonly played classes, stand-out players, and how the meta shifted between tournaments.

      <h3>Tournament Scheduling Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most important things for organizing a tournament is scheduling. A properly scheduled tournament will run extremely smoothly, a poorly scheduled one will be painful for everyone involved. For example,
        I went to a tournament once to support my friend competing, only to find out that they had managed to misestimate the time needed. The end result? They were two hours behind schedule, and my friend wouldn't end up playing 
        his games until 9 o'clock at night. At Sage, we were very cognizant of this, and did a lot of planning to make sure the competitors didn't have to wait too long, and wouldn't be stuck playing late into the night.
        As part of this, one of the analyses I worked on was to estimate average match times. I did this by leveraging the fact that Start.gg, the tournament organization app our events ran on, had an 
        <a href="https://developer.smash.gg/docs/intro/">api</a> that you could query match information. After writing a <a>script <i>github link here</i></a> to pull that information,
        it was easy to estimate an upper limit using the match time statistics, and we were able to schedule accordingly.

        <h2 id=sec5>Self Made Prizes</h2>

        <p>My excuse to use get to play with lasers. One of the major expenses we ran into was the cost of prize money, and this was a challenge not only financially but also from a marketing perspective.
          After all, if every tournament is offering money, it becomes hard to stand out unless you drop huge sums. We didn't huge amounts of funds, so effort was put into exploring potential alternatives that we could offer as prizes.  
          Based on my experience with laser work at my actual job at <a href="../work/work01.html">Prodeon</a>, I struck upon the idea of getting laser etches made based off of the game assets. Some quick searching of laser etching services confirmed 
          that this would solve both of our issues. Costs from laser etching were primarily in setup, so we could be pretty generouse with prizing without breaking the bank. As a rough calculation, using the Velganos etch below as 
          an assumption, we could award every member of the first place team for each region we held tournaments in, a plaque like it, would only cost around $200. This was over 80% cheaper compared to our original cash prizing structure, and 
          would put us on the map as the tournament that had the most unique prizes. A win on both fronts.
        </p>

        <p>I ended up going with a service named <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a>, who were awesome to work with. They helped guide me through alot of the initial issues I faced in preparing the designs for etching, which was vital since I was a complete 
          novice when it game to vector image editing. The general workflow consisted of me importing a game screenshot into <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, and then experimenting with the trace bitmap function until I could get a reasonable vector image. 
          I would then clean up the vector, getting rid of things like small details below the feature size limit, overlapping paths, and in general trying to simplify complicated curves without losing the main 
          artistic elements. This was where the majority of the work was. After the vector was completed, I could submit it through Ponoko's site and receive the part in a few days. I showcase some of the prototype etches I worked on below:
