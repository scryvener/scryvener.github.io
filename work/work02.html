				<h1>SAGE</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
          SAGE was a side gig with some friends, focused around building and strenghening the gaming community through innovation, entertainment, and tournament organization. 
          Our main focus was <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us">Lost Ark</a>, released in February 2022.
        </p>
        <P>
          Technically, I was CTO, Chief Technology Officer. I was responsible for all of our technical projects: building tools that improved the live-stream and competitive experience, 
          tournament analytics, SEO efforts, and technical collaborations. But since there was only ever five people, I wore a lot more hats then just purely tech development, from stream moderating to creating video clips for social media posts.</P>
        <p>
          The title was fancy, but that wasn't really the point. The proudest moments were the messages of thanks from competitors and the viewers.
          The best memories were from working with my friends. Getting to combine my passion for analytics with my hobby of video games was a dream come true. 
          I had a lot of fun working on this, even if issues with the game outside our control led to its early end, and many projects unfinished.</p>

        <h3 id=sec1 alt="">Twitch Extension</h3>
				<p>
          The highlight of my time at SAGE. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/">Twitch Extensions</a> allow for a next level of interactive experiences with the audience,
          beyond just chat. I developed an extension for use with one of our tournaments, allowing viewers to see competitors builds, stats, and other game info that normally wouldn't be accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a major undertaking for two reasons:
          <br>
          <b>First:</b>
          This was my first time coding in html/css/javascript. Minor problem, I know. I was essentially crash coursing my way through this, learning the languages as I built it.
          <br>
          <b>Second:</b>
          The game developer had no public api available, and Twitch required all files, 
          including media, to be submitted as part of the publishing review process, which had to be done days ahead of time.
          Which then ran into the problem that the competitors themseles wouldn't finalize their in-game stats and info until the day of.
          Normally, you could query the api to pull a competitors real time, in-game data, and all this wouldn't be a problem. But there wasn't, and so I had to think of a way to feed the extension information.
          My solution was to create essentially our own psuedo-api, taking the form of an xml page hosted on github that the extension could query to know what data to display. 
          

          
        </p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, I was able to succesfully code a working extension with all of our desired functionality in about a month and a half.
           The extension was successfully used for our tournament, improving the viewing experience of the over 3k people that watched.  </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't all perfect though, I made a lot of mistakes and learned alot as I built my way through this. The most important lesson was the value of testing. 
          Certain bugs compatibility issues could have been detected earlier, a lot of work could have been saved had I tested properly. The bug that stood out was related to displaying a certain number of skills.
          Due to how I wrote the js, essentially an overflow would happen after the skill count went to 10 or more, and skills wouldn't display properly. I was furious with myself when I found the bug, the day before the tournament, and all files 
          essentially frozen. "Test Early, Test Often, and Test Accurately" is now the maxim I repeat to myself. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Lot of words, but wouldn't it be cool if you could play with it yourself? Since Twitch Extensions are built like web pages, I can insert an iframe so you can! Sizing is a bit small, since it was designed for a full screen, but 
          you should be able to see the full functionality. 
          The extension was designed to be draggable, so that viewers could place it wherever worked best for them in the window, and a show/hide functionality so they could hide it when they wanted to focus on the match.
          You can check out the code on github! <i>insert github link</i>
        </p>

        <iframe title="Extension playground" height="600" width="1100" src="../assets/iframe_ext/video_overlay_v3.html"></iframe> <!-- move to css page later-->

        <h3 id=sec2>SEO</h3>
				<p>
          One of my other responsibilities was to research and explore ways of driving traffic to our content, primarily our website and Youtube videos. We were after all, essentially a content creation company, and attention would be how we could eventually monetize.
          I learned a lot about the importance of backlinking, using tags, and other tricks of the trade in order to try and drive more traffic to our content. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Youtube wise my effort was on researching hash tags and video tags, adding channel descriptions and links, and strategizing on how to promote the videos through our other social media, like Twitter.
           The video front was rough, we started our SEO and promotion efforts late, after the initial hype period of release, so we got hurt with the drop in attention as the hype faded. 
        </p>
        <p>In terms of search, my efforts mainly focused on curating the titles, descriptions, and search appearances of our web pages, and thinking of different ways
           to drive traffic and backlinks. One such way was such as embedding our tournament registration and forms on the site directly. Tournament organization was done with a third party, 
           Smash.gg, now <a href="https://www.start.gg/">start.gg</a>, so this would have helped boost our numbers by centering all the user interaction on our pages rather the be split in different locations.
          </p>
        <p>
            I would say I was pretty successful on the search front. From late April, when I started implementing SEO, I pushed us from rank 6-8 in to 1-2 for some of the most relevant keywords, which you can see below.
          </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          Unfortunately though, this is where I learned another important lesson. SEO only works if you have the potential audience in the first place. Put another way,
          It doesn't matter if you're rank 1 on the search query, if only a few people search for that query. Your traffic won't improve dramatically. And that is 
          ultimately the problem we ran into. The competitive PVP aspects of the game just weren't that popular. It had a dedicated fan base that loved what we did, but it was a tiny fraction
          of the overall game population, and with very little support from the game developer themselves. 
          So in the end, i could SEO all I wanted, but it wasn't solving the core issue of how to bring in fresh blood to the competitive scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main takeaway is that SEO is just one tool in the Marketing playbook. Like it's name says, it optimizes. It can help amplify interest, but it can't create interest out of nowhere. You still have to put in the legwork and build a customer base.

          <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/portfolio/3.jpg" alt="">
          It turns out some of the more impactful things you can do are also sometimes the simplest. We did a lot of watching of other Tournament Organizers, and one of the common issues we saw was the difficulty
          in coordinating and ensuring communications between all the competitors. Most just gave a discord channel, which quickly turned into a cacophony as people tried to ping each other in a general chat. 
          Enter our simple solution, a google form that competitors had to fill out with their contact information,
          This also had a side effect in allowing us to collect tournament data on competitor team compositions, a great boon from the analytical perspective.

        <h3 id=sec5>Self Made Prizes</h3>

        <p>My excuse to use get to play with lasers. One of the major expenses we ran into was the cost of prize money, and this was a challenge not only financially but also from a marketing perspective.
          After all, if every tournament is offering money, it becomes hard to stand out unless you drop huge sums. We didn't huge amounts of funds, so effort was put into exploring potential alternatives that we could offer as prizes.  
          Based on my experience with laser work at my actual job at <a href="../work/work01.html">Prodeon</a>, I struck upon the idea of getting laser etches made based off of the game assets. Some quick searching of laser etching services confirmed 
          that this would solve both of our issues. Costs from laser etching were primarily in setup, so we could be pretty generouse with prizing without breaking the bank. As a rough calculation, using the Velganos etch below as 
          an assumption, we could award every member of the first place team for each region we held tournaments in, a plaque like it, would only cost around $200. This was over 80% cheaper compared to our original cash prizing structure, and 
          would put us on the map as the tournament that had the most unique prizes. A win on both fronts.
        </p>

        <p>I ended up going with a service named <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a>, who were awesome to work with. They helped guide me through alot of the initial issues I faced in preparing the designs for etching, which was vital since I was a complete 
          novice when it game to vector image editing. The general workflow consisted of me importing a game screenshot into <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, and then experimenting with the trace bitmap function until I could get a reasonable vector image. 
          I would then clean up the vector, getting rid of things like small details below the feature size limit, overlapping paths, and in general trying to simplify complicated curves without losing the main 
          artistic elements. This was where the majority of the work was. After the vector was completed, I could submit it through Ponoko's site and receive the part in a few days. I showcase some of the prototype etches I worked on below:
