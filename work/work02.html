				<h1>SAGE</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
          SAGE was a side gig with some friends, focused around building and strenghening the gaming community through innovation, entertainment, and tournament organization. 
          Our main focus was <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us">Lost Ark</a>, released in February 2022.
        </p>
        <P>
          Technically, I was CTO, Chief Technical Officer, responsible for building tools that improved the live-stream and competitive experience, 
          tournament analytics, SEO efforts, and technical collaborations. But since there was only ever five people, lots of hats were worn, from stream moderating to creating video clips for social media posts.</P>
        <p>
          The title was fancy, but that wasn't really the point. The proudest moments were the messages of thanks from competitors and the viewers.
          The best memories were from working with my friends. Getting to combine my passion for analytics with my hobby of video games was a dream come true. 
          I had a lot of fun working on this, even if issues with the game outside our control led to its early end, and projects unfinished.</p>

        <h3 id=sec1 alt="">Twitch Extension</h3>
				<p>
          The highlight of my time at SAGE. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/extensions/">Twitch Extensions</a> allow for a next level of interactive experiences with the audience,
          beyond just chat. I developed an extension for use with one of our tournaments, allowing viewers to see competitors builds, stats, and other game info that normally wouldn't be accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a major undertaking for two reasons:
          <br>
          <b>First:</b>
          The game developer had no public api available, and Twitch required all files, 
          including media, to be submitted as part of the publishing review process, which had to be done days ahead of time.
          Which then ran into the problem that the competitors themseles wouldn't finalize their in-game stats and info until the day of.
          Normally, you could query the api to pull a competitors real time, in-game data, and all this wouldn't be a problem. But there wasn't, and so I had to think of a way to feed the extension information.
          My solution was to create essentially our own psuedo-api, taking the form of an xml page hosted on github that the extension could query to know what data to display. 
          <br>

          <b>Second:</b>
          This was my first time coding in html/css/javascript. Small problem I know. I was essentially crash coursing my way through this, learning the languages as I built it.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the challenges, I got it done, in about a month and a half. The extension was successfully used for our tournament, improving the viewing experience of the over 3k people that watched.  </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't all perfect though, I made a lot of mistakes and learned alot as I built my way through this. The most important lesson was the value of testing. 
          Certain bugs compatibility issues could have been detected earlier, a lot of work could have been saved had I tested properly. The bug that stood out was related to displaying a certain number of skills.
          Due to how I wrote the js, essentially an overflow would happen after the skill count went to 10 or more, and skills wouldn't display properly. I was furious with myself when I found the bug, the day before the tournament, and all files 
          essentially frozen. "Test Early, Test Often, and Test Accurately" is now the maxim I repeat to myself. 
        </p>
        
        <p>Lot of words, but wouldn't it be cool if you could play with it yourself? Since Twitch Extensions are built like web pages, I can insert an iframe so you can! Sizing is a bit small, since it was designed for a full screen, but 
          you should be able to see the full functionality. 
          The extension was designed to be draggable, so that viewers could place it wherever worked best for them in the window, and a show/hide functionality so they could hide it when they wanted to focus on the match.
          You can check out the code on github! <i>insert github link</i>
        </p>

        <h3 id=sec2>SEO</h3>
				<p>
          One of my other responsibilities was to research and explore ways of driving traffic to our content, primarily our website and Youtube videos. We were after all, essentially a content creation company, and attention would be how we could eventually monetize.
          I learned a lot about the importance of backlinking, using tags, and other tricks of the trade in order to try and drive more traffic. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Youtube wise my effort was on researching hash tags and video tags, adding channel descriptions and links, and strategizing on how to promote the videos through our other social media, like Twitter.
           The video front was rough, we started our SEO and promotion efforts late, after the initial hype period of release, so we got hurt with the drop in attention as the hype faded. 
        </p>
        <p>In terms of search, my efforts mainly focused on curating the titles, descriptions, and search appearances of our web pages, and thinking of different ways
           to drive traffic and backlinks. One such way was such as embedding our tournament registration and forms on the site directly. Tournament organization was done with a third party, 
           Smash.gg, now <a href="https://www.start.gg/">start.gg</a>, so this would have helped boost our numbers by centering all the user interaction on our pages rather the be split in different locations.
          </p>
        <p>
            I was pretty successful on the search front, pushing us from rank 6-8 to 1-2 for some of the most relevant keywords, which you can see below.

      <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 st">
        <p>
          Unfortunately though, this is where I learned another important lesson. SEO only works if you have the potential audience in the first place. Put another way,
          It doesn't matter if you're rank 1 on the search query, if only a few people search for that query. Your traffic won't improve dramatically. And that is 
          ultimately the problem we ran into. The competitive PVP aspects of the game just weren't that popular. It had a dedicated fan base that loved what we did, but it was a tiny fraction
          of the overall game population, and with very little support from the game developer themselves. 
          So in the end, i could SEO all I wanted, but it wasn't solving the core issue of how to bring in fresh blood to the competitive scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main takeaway is that SEO is just one tool in the Marketing playbook. Like it's name says, it optimizes. It can help amplify interest, but it can't create interest out of nowhere. You still have to put in the legwork and build a customer base.
