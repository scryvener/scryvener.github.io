				<h1>Prodeon Medical / MedeonBio</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Prodeon Medical is where I cut my teeth in the world of medical devices. I was recruited out of college and it was here that I learned what it takes to bring a medical device from a concept to the market.  </p>
        <p>At Prodeon, my responsibilities included design and development of the implant, delivery system and retrieval components. I was also responsible for helping set up the manufacturing, quality Documentation. Finally,
          I supported our pre-clinical and clinical trials, along with marketing related things like physician interactions. I have designed parts in CAD, met with physicians to solicit feedback,
           and written design control documentation.
          I have been in the lab Mac-guyvering parts with a Dremel, been on the line manufacturing units, 
          and been on the ground training the first doctors on how to use our the device. 
          I've been with this project from the very beginning, and helped take it from a concept on the whiteboard to clinical trials.

        <h2 id=sec1 alt="">R&D Design and Development</h2>
				<p>
          True to my title, the largest bulk of my work and responsibilities were in Research and Development.
          My primary responsibilities were designing, prototyping, testing, and iterating the implant, delivery system components and mechanisms, and retrieval accessories.
          Designs and components that I was responsible were successfully used in Animal, First-in-Human, and Investigational Device Exemption(IDE) Clinical Trials. 
          Certain portions of my work are now in the public domain, see patents listed below:

        <h2 id=sec2 alt="">Manufacturing</h2>
				<p>
          Lot of hats were worn at Prodeon, one of which was manufacturing. 
          My responsibilities here mainly focused on authoring the process instructions needed to manufacture our device, working on the assembly line itself, and training new operators. 
          During my time at Prodeon, we successfully completed over half a dozen builds, supporting Design Verification, Validation activities, and clinical trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also successfully led and closed NCR-triggered investigations, to ensure the quality of the product.
          These ran the gamut, from dimensions being out of tolerance during incoming inspection to assembly issues discovered on the manufacturing line. 
        </p>

        <h2 id=sec3 alt="">Documentation and Quality</h2>
				<p>
          Medical Device development would not be complete without documentation. My work here could be divided into two main categories, R&D Design Control related work and product testing related work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My Design Control work included authoring the technical drawings for components I was responsible for, and also associated specs in our Product Specification document.
          Risk documentation was also a significant portion of my work here.
          I was responsible for authoring Hazard Analyses, and various Failure Mode Effects Analyses cover the design and use of our various devices.
          Finally, I also provided support for design reviews, authoring everything from memos to powerpoint slides to gap analyses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing work encompassed all the documentation that came with both in-house testing we did, such as functional deployment, and testing performed with outside partners, such as for biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, MRI safety, or Finite Element Analyses.
          I was responsible for authoring Test Protocols and Reports, as well as Standard Test Methods(STM).
          For many STMs, I also was responsible for executing a Gauge R&R Study on our test methods.
          I was in charge of setting up the design of the study, executing it, and then analyzing the data in <a href="https://www.minitab.com/en-us/">Minitab</a>, looking at the variance components and the ANOVA report. 
          In certain cases, some test methods had unacceptabily high variance, and so I was also responsible for coming up with solutions to reduce it. 
          Most methods could be improved by simply using more precise equipment, ie swapping a ruler for caliper.
          However, for certain methods, especially those unique to our device, this entailed having to rethink how the test was executed, or having to implement changes to the test fixture.

        <h2 id=sec4 alt="">Pre-Clinical and Clinical Trials</h2>
				<p>
          Probably the most interesting part of my work was related to supporting Pre-Clinical and Clinical Trials, and not just because I got to travel.
          Any medical device development is always accompanied by testing both in-vivo and in-vitro.
          At Prodeon Medical, I got to test the devices I had the opportunity to be directly involved in cadaver, animal, and First-in-Human clinical trials.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <P>
          I was extensively involved with animal trials as well, both to help evaluate potential designs, and also to test the long-term efficacy of the implant. Here I manufactured and prepared devices to be used, 
          worked with the vetinary surgeon to implant the devices, and analyzed the collected data such as x-rays. I was also responsible for defining and executing our post-retrieval testing for the implants, which included 
          mechanical testing, and SEM imaging of the surface.
          
        </P>
        <p>
          When the time came for clinical trials, I was on the ground in Europe, Asia, and Australia training the first physicians for the First in Human <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03758222">EXPANDER-1 Trial</a>.
          I also provided remote technical support and helped execute device deficiency investigations.
        </p>

        <h2 id=sec5 alt="">Marketing and Physician Feedback</h2>

        <P> Getting feedback from end-users of the product you develop is important, and at Prodeon, I regularly interfaced with Physicians to get their feedback on design decisions. Through local physicians,
          we were able to drive a rapid prototype schedule. We would frequently develop using a shotgun approach of 3-4 different concpets or variations, and then bring them to evaluate. Through this rapid pace, 
          we were able to go from concept to a First-in-Human trial in around 2 years. 
        </P>
        <p>One highlight was when I got to attend the 2018 American Urology Association meeting in San Francisco with the rest of the team. It was an invaluable experience, where we were able to demo to both 
          potential partners and active collaborators our next generation designs. I was also able to take the chance to familiarize myself with the state of the art in Urology, such as new surgical robotics, which helped 
          build a better understanding of the strength's of our product's approach. 
          </p>
				<p>
          Marketing is also how I began becoming interested in data analytics work. Our marketing manager was developing financial models to project future growth, and model the current market state, ie which procedures were used most often.
          The problem sounded interesting enough to me, and so I independently embarked on a hunt to see what I could put together on my own. You can see the result of my little side adventure <a>here</a>. <!-- link out to project section  -->
